# SAS-workflows ‚Äì FAIR workflows for small-angle scattering data

Welcome to the SAS-workflows repository! You can find published workflows that solve specific problems for small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data, and more in here.

## üõ§ What is SAS-workflows?

The SAS-workflows contains various Jupyter Notebooks that implement [SAS-tools](https://github.com/FAIRChemistry/SAS-tools) and other packages/libaries to work with SAS data to answer a certain research question, to solve a given problem, or perform a specific task (called **workflows**). These workflows can be used as examples for implementing SAS-tools, as well as as templates and inspiration for novel workflows.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

Get started with SAS-workflows by cloning this repository and modifying a Notebook that solves a similar problem to yours:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FAIRChemistry/SAS-workflows/
cd SAS-workflows
jupyter lab    # alternatively: jupyter notebook
```

## üîñ Example Code
